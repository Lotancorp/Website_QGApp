      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>When we sleep, the body may appear inactive, but the brain is actually working intensely. It manages physical recovery, memory consolidation, emotion regulation, and metabolic processes. Sleep isn’t just rest—it’s a complex biological phase vital for overall health.</p>

      <h2>Sleep Stages</h2>
      <p>The brain organizes sleep into two main cycles: <strong>Non-REM</strong> and <strong>REM (Rapid Eye Movement)</strong>. These cycles repeat every 90–120 minutes throughout the night.</p>

      <h3>1. Non-REM Stage</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>N1 (Transition):</strong> The initial stage of sleep. Brain activity begins to slow. Hypnic jerks often occur here.</li>
        <li><strong>N2 (Light Sleep):</strong> Muscle activity decreases, body temperature drops, and brain waves continue to slow.</li>
        <li><strong>N3 (Deep Sleep / Slow Wave Sleep):</strong> The deepest, most restorative sleep. The brain produces delta waves. During this stage, the body repairs cells, strengthens the immune system, and restores energy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. REM Stage</h3>
      <p>In REM sleep, the brain becomes highly active—almost at wakeful levels. Vivid dreaming takes place here. At the same time, the body experiences <em>REM atonia</em>, a temporary muscle paralysis that prevents us from acting out our dreams.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brain:</strong> Active—processing emotions and memories</li>
        <li><strong>Body:</strong> Paralyzed (unable to move)</li>
        <li><strong>Eyes:</strong> Rapidly moving beneath closed lids</li>
        <li><strong>Heart rate &amp; breathing:</strong> Become irregular</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Brain Activity During Sleep</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hippocampus:</strong> Processes and transfers short-term memories into long-term storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Prefrontal Cortex:</strong> Slows down, which is why dreams often seem illogical.</li>
        <li><strong>Amygdala:</strong> Remains active, processing emotions—explains why dreams can be emotional.</li>
        <li><strong>Brainstem:</strong> Regulates muscle atonia and the sleep-wake transition.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Functions of Sleep for the Brain</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Consolidates memories and learning</li>
        <li>Neutralizes stress and negative emotions</li>
        <li>Produces essential hormones (like melatonin and growth hormone)</li>
        <li>Removes metabolic waste from the brain (via the glymphatic system)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The brain never truly “turns off” during sleep—it plays a crucial role in both physical and mental restoration. By understanding the sleep cycles and how the brain functions, we can appreciate the importance of getting sufficient, high-quality sleep to maintain overall brain and body health.</p>
