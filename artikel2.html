      <h2>What Is a Hypnic Jerk?</h2>
      <p><strong>Hypnic jerk</strong>, also called a <em>hypnagogic jerk</em>, is a sudden reflex movement of the body just as someone begins to fall asleep. It’s often accompanied by a sensation of falling or losing control, causing you to jolt awake. This phenomenon is common and occurs during the transition from wakefulness into light sleep (stage N1).</p>

      <h2>Scientific Explanation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brain misinterpretation:</strong> The brain may interpret muscle relaxation as a signal that the body is falling and respond with a sudden jerk.</li>
        <li><strong>Residual sympathetic activity:</strong> Tension, caffeine, or high activity before bed can keep the nervous system alert.</li>
        <li><strong>Evolutionary theory:</strong> It may stem from a primitive instinct to keep balance when humans slept in elevated or precarious places.</li>
      </ul>

          <th>Symptom</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Sudden jerk</td>
          <td>Leg or arm twitch as you start to drift off</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Sensation of falling</td>
          <td>Feeling like you’re slipping or dropping from a height</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Rapid heartbeat</td>
          <td>The body’s reflex response to the “shock”</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Brief awakening</td>
          <td>Instant awareness and difficulty returning to sleep if anxious</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Causes &amp; Risk Factors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fatigue or lack of sleep</li>
        <li>Stress, anxiety, or an active mind before bed</li>
        <li>Caffeine or nicotine consumption in the evening</li>
        <li>Strenuous exercise too close to bedtime</li>
        <li>Too-rapid transition into sleep</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Reduce Hypnic Jerks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep a consistent sleep schedule</li>
        <li>Cut back on caffeine in the late afternoon/evening</li>
        <li>Practice relaxation before bed (deep breathing, dhikr, gentle stretching)</li>
        <li>Avoid heavy exercise close to bedtime</li>
        <li>Ensure your sleep environment is comfortable and quiet</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Islamic Perspective</h2>
      <p>Islam doesn’t explicitly mention hypnic jerks, but it teaches sleep etiquettes that align with calming both body and mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Perform ablution (wudhu) before sleeping</li>
        <li>Recite Ayat al-Kursi and the short surahs</li>
        <li>Sleep on your right side</li>
        <li>Make supplication and entrust yourself to Allah</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These practices not only provide spiritual protection but also help reduce stress and ease the transition into sleep, lowering the chance of sudden sleep jerks.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p><strong>Hypnic jerks are a normal reaction as the body enters sleep.</strong> They aren’t harmful, but you can prevent or lessen them by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and following good sleep etiquettes. If they happen frequently, check whether you’re overly tired or your mind isn’t calm at bedtime. In Islam, sleep isn’t just a biological need but also a spiritual moment—so it’s important to rest in peace and surrender.</p>
